The following lines of code are used to make a list of links to the textbook .pdf files in 
textbook2.html and textbook5.html.  However, our group realized you may want to add more to 
the list in the future, which we had to think pretty creatively to account for.  Our best 
idea was to make detailed instructions on how to add the links to the .pdf files yourself
in a very easy to use way.  All you need to do is copy/paste the link where it says "YOUR 
LINK HERE" (IMPORTANT NOTE: KEEP THE QUOTATION MARKS).

<ul class = "rightside">
			<li>Unit 1</li> <!--Use this line for each new Unit Header-->
			<li><a href="YOUR LINK HERE">YOUR TEXT HERE</a></li> <!--Copy this line and use as many times as necessary-->
			<!--Paste above line here above the "</ul>"-->
</ul>
